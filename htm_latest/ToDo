ToDo

--Clean Up--
neaten encoders
neaten factory
something something something generator
some factory functions have config parameters passed in whilst others access them directly?


--Future--
rethink boosting algorithm
add column center bias to the input synapses (phase 1 spatial pooling in BAMI)
something something something topology
is there any reason to make synapses object oriented?
    is there any reason not to would be the better question: are objects less efficient than arrays?

--Note Well--
encoder classifer as a dict will only work for numeric inputs
